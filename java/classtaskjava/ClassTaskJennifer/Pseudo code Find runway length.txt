Pseudo code Find runway length

- prompt user to enter take off speed in meter/second(m/s)
- collect and store as takeOffSpeed
- prompt user to enter acceleration in meters/second squared(m/s^2)
- collect and store as acceleration

- calculate minimum runway length with :
		v^2/2a
-takeOffSpeed is v and acceleration is a

- collect and store result as minimumRunwayLength
- Display minimumRunwayLength
