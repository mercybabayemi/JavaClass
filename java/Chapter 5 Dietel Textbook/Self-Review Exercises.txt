Self-Review Exercises
5.1 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
a) Typically, __for iteration __ statements are used for counter-controlled iteration and __while iteration__ statements for sentinel-controlled iteration.

b) The do…while statement tests the loop-continuation condition __after_
executing the loop’s body; therefore, the body always executes at least once.

c) The _switch_ statement selects among multiple actions based on the possible values of an integer variable or expression, or a String.

d) The _continue keyword_ statement, when executed in an iteration statement, skips the remaining statements in the loop body and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop. 

e) The _conditional and_ operator (with short-circuit evaluation) can be used to ensure that two conditions are both true before choosing a certain path of execution.

f) If the loop-continuation condition in a for header is initially _false_, the program does not execute the for statement’s body.

g) Methods that perform common tasks and do not require objects are _static_ methods.

5.2 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
a) The default case is required in the switch selection statement.
Ans: False, it is optional if the programmer ensures that all cases have been taken care of, however, it is recommended for the cases that are not met to be covered.

b) The break statement is required in the last case of a switch selection statement.
Ans: False, break keyword is not required because the switch condition is checked before the next execution.

c) The expression ((x > y) && (a < b)) is true if either x > y is true or a < b is true.
Ans: False, the logical conditional evaluates to be true only if both conditions are true.

d) An expression containing the || operator is true if either or both of its operands are true.
Ans: True

e) The comma (,) formatting flag in a format specifier (e.g., %,20.2f) indicates that a value should be output with a grouping separator. 
Ans: True

f) To test for a range of values in a switch statement, use a hyphen (–) between the start and end values of the range in a case label.
Ans: False, we do not use hyphen to test for range in switch statement.

g) Listing cases consecutively with no statements between them enables the cases to perform the same set of statements.
Ans: True.


5.4 Find the error in each of the following code segments, and explain how to correct it:
a)
1 i = 1; 
2 while (i <= 10);
3 ++i;
4 }
Ans: 
1 int i = 1; 
2 while (i <= 10){
3 	++i;
4 }


b) 
1 for (k = 0.1; k != 1.0; k += 0.1) {
2 System.out.println(k);
3 }
Ans: 
There is an error with the for header statement, no initialization type, infinit loop continuation condition.
1 for (double k = 0.1; k > 1.0; k += 0.1) {
2 	System.out.println(k);
3 }

c) 
 switch (n) {
2 case 1:
3 System.out.println("The number is 1");
4 case 2:
5 System.out.println("The number is 2");
6 break;
7 default:
8 System.out.println("The number is not 1 or 2");
9 break;
10 }
Ans: 
1 switch (n) {
2 	case 1:
3 		System.out.println("The number is 1");
		break;
4 	case 2:
5 		System.out.println("The number is 2");
6 		break;
7 	default:
8 		System.out.println("The number is not 1 or 2");
9 		break;
10 }


d) The following code should print the values 1 to 10:
1 n = 1;
2 while (n < 10) {
3 System.out.println(n++);
4 } 
Ans: 
1 int n = 1;
2 	while (n <= 10) {
3 		System.out.println(n++);
4 	}

Exercises
5.5 Describe the four basic elements of counter-controlled iteration. 
Ans: 
It contains
a. counter controlled iteration
b. Keyword and loop continuation condition
c. Statement body
d. incrementation when applicable.

5.6 Compare and contrast the while and for iteration statements.
Ans: The major difference between while and for loop is the keywords. Their syntax can be arranged accordingly.

5.7 If you need to execute the body of a loop at least once, would it be better to use a do…while statement or a while statement?
Ans: do while loop

5.8 Compare and contrast the break and continue statements.
Ans: The break statement is used to exit an iteration while the continue statement is used  to skip present iteration to next iteration.

5.9 Find and correct the error(s) in each of the following segments of code:
a) while (i = 1; i <= 10, i+)
System.out.println(i);
Ans: 
while (i = 1; i <= 10, i+)
	System.out.println(i);
}

b) The following code should print whether an integer value is negative or zero:
switch (value) {
 Case value < 0:
 System.out.println("Negative");
 case 0:
 System.out.println("Zero");
 } 
Ans: There is no break statement after the first case. However, the first case expression is supposed to be a constant variable and not a constant.

c) The following code should output the odd integers from 19 to 1:
for (int i = 19; i > 1; i =+ 1)
 System.out.println(i);
Ans:
for (int i = 19; i >= 1; i -- 1){
	System.out.println(i);
}


d) The following code should output the even integers from 1 to 50:
counter = 0;
do {
 System.out.println(counter + 1);
 counter += 2;
} while (counter <= 51);
Ans:
counter = 0;
do {
	System.out.println(counter + 1);
 	counter += 2;
} while (counter <= 50);


5.10 What does the following program do?
1 // Exercise 5.10: Printing.java
2 public class Counting {
3 public static void main( String[] args ) { 
4 Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in); 
5 
6 for (int i = 1; i < 3; i++) {
7 for (int j = 1; j < 5; j++)
8 System.out.print('*');
9 System.out.println("\n#####");
10 } // end outer for loop
11 } // end main 
12 } // end class Counting
