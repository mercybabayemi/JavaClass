Pseudocode for WorldPopulationGrowthCalculator
stage 1
- Prompt user to enter current world population
- Collect and save as currentWorldPopulation
- Prompt user to enter current world population growth rate
- Collect and save as annualGrowthRate
- Calculate growth factor with 1 + annualGrowtRate
- Collect and save as growthFactor
- Initialise 75 to numberOfYears
- Intilaise 0 to previousPopulation
- Create an iteration to calculate years from 1 to 75
- Calculate each year population with currentWorldpopulation multiplied by growthfactor raised to the power of year
-Collect and save as calculatedPopulation
- Display the year in first column
- Display anticipated world population at the end of the year in second column
- Display numerical increase in world population occurring that year by deducting previous world population from current population.
- PreviousPopulation is equal calculated population 

- Calculate currentWorldPopulation * 2 
- Collect and store as doublePopulation
- Divide doublepopulation by currentWorldPopulation , then take logarithm of result. Divide result by logarithm of growthfactor to get exact year
- Collect and save result as yearOfDoubledPopulation
