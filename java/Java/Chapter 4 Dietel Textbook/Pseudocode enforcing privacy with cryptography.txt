Pseudocode enforcing privacy with cryptography.
- All data is transmitted as four digit integers. 
- Prompt user to enter a four digit integer.
- Collect and store as firstNumber
- While digit length is less than 4, keep prompting.
- Replace each didgit with the result of adding 7 to the digit and get the remainder after diving the new value by 10.
- Swap the first digit with the third and swap the second digit with the fourth.
- Then print theencrypted integer.

- A separate application that input encrypted four digit integer aand decrypt it by reversing the encryption scheme to form the original number.
