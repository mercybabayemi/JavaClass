Self-Review Exercises
4.1 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
a) All programs can be written in terms of three types of control structures: __sequence structure__ , __Selection structure__ and __Iteration structure__.
b) The __if else or double selection __ statement is used to execute one action when a condition is true and another when that condition is false.
c) Repeating a set of instructions a specific number of times is called __counter controlled or definite__ iteration.
d) When it’s not known in advance how many times a set of statements will be repeated, a(n) __sentinel /flag/ dummy__ value can be used to terminate the iteration.
e) The __sequence__ structure is built into Java; by default, statements execute in the order they appear.
f) Instance variables of types char, byte, short, int, long, float and double are all given
the value __0_ by default.
g) If the increment operator is __prefix__ to a variable, first the variable is incremented by 1, then its new value is used in the expression.
h) When the declaration int y = 5; is followed by the assignment y += 3.3; the value of y is __5__.


4.2 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
a) An algorithm is a procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions to execute and the order in which they execute.
Ans = true

b) A set of statements contained within a pair of parentheses is called a block.
Ans= false. A block is marked by curly braces not parenthesis. 

c) A selection statement repeats an action while a condition remains true.
Ans= false. An iteration structure repeats an action while a condition remain true. However, a selection statement checks if a condition is true or false and performs the instruction given.

d) A nested control statement appears in the body of another control statement.
Ans= true.

e) Java provides the arithmetic compound assignment operators +=, -=, *=, /= and %= for abbreviating assignment expressions.
Ans = true.
 
f) The primitive types (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double) are portable across only Windows platforms.
Ans = False, this cut across all platforms , not restricted to only windows platforms.

g) Specifying the order in which statements execute in a program is called program control.
Ans = False, they are called sequential exacution.

h) The unary cast operator (double) creates a temporary integer copy of its operand.
Ans= false. Double casting does not create an integer. It creates a temporary variable copy of its type.

i) Instance variables of type boolean are given the value true by default.
Ans = false.

j) Pseudocode helps you think out a program before attempting to write it in a programming language.
Ans= true.

4.3 Write four different Java statements that each add 1 to integer variable x.
Ans = x = 10;
x = x + 1;
x += 1;
++x;
x++;

4.4 Write Java statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:
a) Use one statement to assign the sum of x and y to z, then increment x by 1.
Ans =
z = x++ + y;

b) Test whether variable count is greater than 10. If it is, print "Count is greater than 10".
Ans = 
if(count > 10){
	System.out.print("Count is greater than 10");
}

c) Use one statement to decrement the variable x by 1, then subtract it from variable total and store the result in variable total. 
Ans = 
variableTotal = --x - variableTotal;

d) Calculate the remainder after q is divided by divisor, and assign the result to q. Write this statement in two different ways.
Ans = 
q = q / divisor;
q /= divisor;

4.5 Write a Java statement to accomplish each of the following tasks:
a) Declare variable sum of type int and initialize it to 0.
Ans = 
int sum = 0;

b) Declare variable x of type int and initialize it to 1.
Ans =
int x = 1;

c) Add variable x to variable sum, and assign the result to variable sum.
Ans = 
int sum += x;

d) Print "The sum is: ", followed by the value of variable sum.
Ans =
System.out.print("The sum is : " + sum);

4.6 Combine the statements that you wrote in Exercise 4.5 into a Java application that calculates and prints the sum of the integers from 1 to 10. Use a while statement to loop through the calculation and increment statements. The loop should terminate when the value of x becomes 11.
Ans = 
public class Exercise4_6{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int sum = 0;
		int x = 1;
		while(x <= 10){
			sum += x;
			System.out.print("The sum is : " + sum);
			x++;
		}
	}
}

4.7 Determine the value of the variables in the statement product *= x++; after the calculation is performed. Assume that all variables are type int and initially have the value 5.
Ans = 25 because 1 will be added to x if we print it again 


4.8 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following code segments—assume that all variables have been properly declared and initialized:
	a)  
1 while (c <= 5) {
2 	product *= c;
3 	++c; 
4 }
	b)
1 if (gender == 1) {
2 	System.out.println("Woman");
3 }
4 else{
5 	System.out.println("Man");
6 } 

4.9 What is wrong with the following while statement?
1 while (z >= 0) {
2 sum += z;
3 } 
Ans = No initialization for z and sum prior to be sure if the condition is true or false. There is no postfix or prefix for z as well. The wile loop might run infinitely.
