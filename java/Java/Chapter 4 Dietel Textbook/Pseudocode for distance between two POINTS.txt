Pseudocode for distance between two points.
- Prompt user to enter the x coordinate for point 1
- Collect and save as pointOneX
- Prompt user to enter the y coordinate for point 1
- Collect and store as pointOneY
- Prompt user to enter the x coordinate for point 2
- Collect and save as pointTwoX
- Prompt user to enter the y coordinate for point 2
- Collect and store as pointTwoY
- If pointOneX is equal to pointTwoX, display "The points are on a line parallel to the X-axis and perpendicular to Y-axis."
- Else if pointOneY is equal to pointTwoY, "The points are on a line parallel to the Y-axis and perpendicular to X-axis."
- Else display "Line is not perpendicular to axis.
