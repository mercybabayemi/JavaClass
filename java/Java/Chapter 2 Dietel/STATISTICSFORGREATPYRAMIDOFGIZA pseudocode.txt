STATISTICSFORPYRAMID pseudocode

1. Enter estimated total number of stones used for pyramid
2. Enter estimated number of weight of stones used to build pyramid
3. Enter estimated number of years used to build pyramid
4. Enter estimated numbers of workers
5. Enter estimated numbers of working hours per day
6. Enter estimated numbers of working days per year
7. Enter estimated length of the pyramid
8. Enter estimated height of the pyramid
9. Calculate the average weight of each stone with:
	 Total weight of stones/ number of stones
10. Calculate the volume of how much of the pyramids was built each year with: 
	Math.sqrt(3) / 2 * (length * length) * height
11. Calculate the estimate of how much of the pyramids was built each year with: 
	Total volume / number of years
12. Calculate the estimate of how much of the pyramids was built each day with:	
	yearly construction rate / working days per year
13. Calculate the estimate of how much of the pyramids was built each hour with:
	daily construction rate / working hours per day
14.  Calculate the estimate of how much of the pyramids was built each minute with:
    	hourly construction rate / 60
15. Display result.
