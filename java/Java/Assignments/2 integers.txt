2 integers
STAGE 1
1. Prompt user to enter two integers.
2. Multiply first  number by 3.
3. Multiply second number by 2.
4. initialize zero = 0.
4. If result of multiple of first number % result of multiple of second number == 0, print result 1 is a multiple of result 2, else print result 1 is not a multiple of result 2.

STAGE 2
1. Prompt user to enter the first number.
2. Collect first number .
3. Store first number as 'num1'.
4. Prompt user to enter the second number.
5. Collect second number .
6. Store second number as 'num2'.
7. Multiply 'num1' by 3.
5. Collect result .
6. Store result as 'multiple1'.
7. Multiply 'num2' by 2.
5. Collect result .
6. Store result as 'multiple2'.
7. Instantiate result to multiple1 % multiple 2 
8. If result == 0, print 'num1' is a multiple of 'num2'.
9. Else print num1 is not a multiple of num2.
