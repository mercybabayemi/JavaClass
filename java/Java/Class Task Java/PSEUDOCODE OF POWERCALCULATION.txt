- Initialize result multiplier
- iterate condition and statement
- Multiply result by base
- Automate counter
- Display result

Stage 2
- Declare class
- Declare main methods

- Prompt user to enter number for exponent
- Initialize 'result' multiplier to 1
- iterate condition and statement using for loop
