Pseudo code  calculating energy

- prompt user to enter amount of water in kilogram 
- collect and store as waterAmount
- prompt user to enter initial temperature
- collect and store as initialTemperature
- prompt user to enter final temperature
- collect and store as finalTemperature
- calculate energy needed with :
		 M * (finalTemperature - initialTemperature)

-where m is the weight of water in kilogram, temperature are in degrees Celsius and energy q is measures in joules.
- collect and store result as energy
- Display energy
