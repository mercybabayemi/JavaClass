Pseudocode HugeInteger class
Stage one
- Create a 40 element array of digits storing integers as large as 40 digits each. 
- Provide method parse, toString, add and subtract.
- Method parse receive a string, extract each digit using charat and place the integer equivalent of each digit in the integer array.
- Compare with methods isEqualTo, isGreaterThan, isLessThan, isGreaterThan, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo and isLessThanOrEqualTo.
- Return true or false if value held in two hugeIntegerObjects holds or not.
- Provide method multiply, divide and remainder.

Stage two 
- Import BigDecimal from the java.math package
- In main method, declare a new 40 element array of big decimal
- Collect and name as bigDecimalDigit
- Create a public static method named getParsedValue receiving a string and parsing it to return arguement of bigdecimal
- Create a public static method named getBigDecimalAddition receiving two objects of big decimal and returning their sum as arguement.
- Create a public static method named getBigDecimalSubtraction receiving two objects of big decimal and returning the result.
- In main method, import scanner from java.util package
- Create a scanner object receiving constructor System.in
- Collect and save object as input.
- Loop through the length of big decimal array to get the elements at each index
- Prompt user to enter a 40 element digit
- Read input digits with .nextLine 
- Save as String input
- if input length is less than 40, prompt user to keep entering a 40 digit element.
- Invoke getParsedValue to convert values from string to digit
- Pass the returned values of method getParsedValue to the element at index of BigDecimal array.
- Create a public static method named isEqualTo receiving two objects of big decimal and returning a boolean result.
- Create a public static method named isGreaterThan receiving two objects of big decimal and returning a boolean result.
- Create a public static method named isLessThan receiving two objects of big decimal and returning a boolean result.
- Create a public static method named isGreaterThanOrEqualTo receiving two objects of big decimal and returning a boolean result.
- Create a public static method named isLessThanOrEqualTo receiving two objects of big decimal and returning a boolean result.
- Provide method multiply,divid and remainder.
- if iteration value is greater than 0, invoke methods  isEqualTo, isGreaterThan, isLessThan, isGreaterThan, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo and isLessThanOrEqualTo between the particular index value and the index value - 1.
- Create a public static method named getMultiplication receiving two objects of big decimal and returning result.
- Create a public static method named getDivision receiving two objects of big decimal and returning result.
- Create a public static method named getRemainder receiving two objects of big decimal and returning result.
